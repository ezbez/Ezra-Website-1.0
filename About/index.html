			<p class="title">HELLO</p>
			<div class mainText>
				I'm Ezra. I'm 41 years old, grew up in North London not far from Finsbury Park and I'm a landscape
				gardener. I have big family who mostly live in the area, an incredible fiance called Rosie and a
				beautiful little boy called Florian.
				<br>
				<br>
				I thought the mosaic gallery main page I've made would give a decent snapshot of who I am, which it kind
				of does... maybe more just a snapshot of holidays I've been on over the years. It's the first unique
				thing I've made using code. I've done some code alongs and playing around but no complete projects - and
				I really enjoyed it. I really love making things, chipping away at them until they're just as I'd
				imagined. Which makes the learning part actually, for the most part, really enjoyable, because as I'm
				learning about some new property or method I'm constantly thinking about how I could use it to make
				something. Very easy to get sidetracked though.
				<br>
				<br>
				I think I would love working as a software engineer. I want to learn all I possibly can, and I get a
				excited by the challenge. Founders and Coders just seems oddly perfect for who I am and I'd really love
				the chance to study there.
